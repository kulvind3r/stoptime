# StopTime

A unique stopwatch and timer app where both stop watch and timer act on the same
time counter.

Counter increases in time when running stopwatch and decreases on running timer.

Idea was born from the thought "**Earning Leisure Time by Spending Time on Growth**".

User should use the stopwatch to track the time they spend while working on their
growth activity (study/work/chores). Time spent in activity is tracked and earns
you an equivalent time to spend on your leisure which you track by running the timer,
once you have spent all your earned time you should go back to working on your growth.
